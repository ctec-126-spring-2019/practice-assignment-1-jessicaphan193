    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to <b><i>The Page</i></b>. My name is Jessica and I am currently learning to be a Web Devloper at Clark College. I have been here for about 3 years ever since I started during my senior year in high school. I'm pretty happy of how far I came, and learned a lot web development at Clark College. Bruce and Bob will be you BFF in the program.</p>

    <h2>What to Accomplish</h2>
    <p>What I want to accomplish in this class is to figure out what makes JavaScript important; why and how it became to what it is known for today. Knowing that Javascript is nearly everywhere today makes me want to go in-depth and learn something new to increase my skills.</p>

    <h2>Programming Skills/Languages</h2>
    <p>I'm unsure where I land as of for programming skils wise... but down below are a few programming languages that I know. As of right now, I don't really have a current favorite programming language, but so far I'm sort of liking Javascript.</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>PHP(semi)</li>
            <li>C#(semi)</li>
        </ul>
